# facebook_scammer
Here I am building up a list of potentially scammer or facebook account linked to suspicious activities.   I will not be describing how I come to this conclusion but you find judge and find out for yourself.   The heuristics I used is so simple, and I am sure Facebook can do a better job detecting these anomalous activities.

In general, all these account usually are alerted to me through "friend request".
